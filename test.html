		<h2>This is the Title</h1>
		I like making websites, especially during class, and here are the reasons why:
		<ul>
			<li>it is fun</li>
			<li>it is better than class</li>
		</ul>
		I still don't know how to:
		<ol>
			<li>change image size</li>
			<li>change color or anything like that</li>
		</ol>
